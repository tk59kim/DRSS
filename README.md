# DRSS v0.0.1 – First Run Success

- 📅 July 6, 2025
- ✅ Successfully plotted VER vs HAM at Monza 2023
- 🧠 Learned how to:
  - Set up virtual environments
  - Install & run FastF1
  - Debug git and VS Code
  - Plot telemetry data

Next goal: Add throttle and brake traces

🆕 DRSS v0.0.2 – Sector Insight + Accuracy Shift
📅 July 6, 2025 (later same day)
🎯 Focus: Sector-based analysis & improved visualization clarity

✅ Key Updates
Replaced speed-based shading with time delta dominance (more accurate)

Switched comparison to Verstappen vs. Sainz (Monza 2023 Quali)

Added sector boundaries to split lap by performance zones

Implemented color-coded track overlays:

🔵 Blue = VER faster

🔴 Red = SAI faster

⚪️ Gray = virtually even

Built and interpreted per-sector time delta summaries

Used telemetry to explain how Sainz narrowly beat VER by 0.013s

Resolved issues with driver naming, file structure, and plotting thickness

📊 DRSS Modules in Use
track_dominance_map.py — updated for:

Sector slicing

Delta-based color grading

Better legends and visuals

Added ver_vs_sai_monza.png to tracked outputs

🔜 Next Goals
 Add throttle and brake traces

 Display lap time delta line graphs (Δt vs. distance)

 Automate sector detection using FastF1 data

 Modularize script into src/ or modules/ folder

 Enable user input: select two drivers, a race, and plot results
